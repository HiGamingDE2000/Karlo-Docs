We are always using the newest version of the programming language you selected, but you can change them by changing the Docker Image. If you are using Python or JavaScript you can install the packages by setting for python: "Additional Python Packages" or upload an requirements.txt or for JavaScript: "Additional Node Packages".

To start your server go back to Console and click "Start"
